 * data transfer object.
 * <p><br>
 * The methods of this class provide easy access to all award related data which was returned by the remote service in
 * JSON format. Properties that are declared to be nullable in the remote service documentation will be returned as Java
 * Optionals.
 * <p><br>
 * The sole purpose of these DTO objects is to encapsulate the exact raw JSON data as received from the remote service
 * in order to facilitate API integration by working with simple Java POJO's instead of nested JSON nodes. Although
 * there will be no intense post-processing of the actual JSON values a type-casting may be applied to <u>some</u> of
 * them to improve the usability and relieve the API user of this task.
